# Open Positions

We invite you to join our R&D campus in [ISTC, Yerevan, Armenia](https://goo.gl/maps/oFUpANPHHSmSDWYd8).<br/>

---

Unum is a startup, so the roles shift a lot.<br/>
Skills and experiences are relevant, but so is the ability to learn and jump between subjects.<br/>
We have an **always-open wildcard position** for people with solid coding skills in C++/Python and strong background in mathematics, computer science, or any other STEM subject.<br/>
Please, read the rest of this page and if it feels like you can be part of this - [reach us!](mailto:a@unum.am)
